# CS50W_2020
My code from following the lectures at the [Harvard Web Programming Course CS50W (2020)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn7EX3zkGUo&list=PLhQjrBD2T380xvFSUmToMMzERZ3qB5Ueu). 

CS50W is CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. My goal is to gain "hands-on" coding experience by working the examples explained in the lectures.  I want to develop a deep understanding of Web programming, going much further than any particular technology, but more like the "philosophy" of the Web. I have learned, over the course of my career, that there's no better way of learning programming than getting my hands dirty.

Although only Harvard students can register for credit, [anyone with an Internet connection can view the course materials for free](https://cs50.edx.org/web).

>This course picks up where Harvard University's CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semesterâ€™s end, students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.
